# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing a comprehensive UI/UX design system for the aida-assistentes-platform based on the detailed design analysis and vision provided. The goal is to create a consistent, accessible, and professional interface that follows the "Clareza Focada: A Interface como um Assistente Silencioso" philosophy - where the design becomes almost invisible, allowing users to focus entirely on creating and managing AI assistants.

The implementation will establish a cohesive design system with standardized components, consistent visual hierarchy, improved navigation feedback, and enhanced user experience patterns across the entire platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a consistent and professional visual design system, so that I can navigate and use the platform intuitively without visual distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the platform loads THEN the system SHALL display a dark mode interface with the specified color palette (#111827 background, #1F2937 surfaces, #4F46E5 accent)
2. WHEN viewing any component THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing based on 8px grid multiples (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
3. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Inter font for UI elements and JetBrains Mono for code/technical data
4. WHEN viewing different interface elements THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy using defined font weights and sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want clear navigation feedback and intuitive sidebar navigation, so that I always know where I am in the platform and can move between sections effortlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to any page THEN the system SHALL highlight the active navigation item with accent color background and left border indicator
2. WHEN hovering over navigation items THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback with smooth transitions
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL show clear focus states on all interactive elements
4. WHEN the sidebar contains multiple sections THEN the system SHALL group related items under clear section headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want consistent and informative feedback for all my actions, so that I understand the system's response and current state at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing any action THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states (skeleton loaders for content, button spinners for actions)
2. WHEN an action succeeds or fails THEN the system SHALL display consistent toast notifications using defined colors (green for success, red for error, amber for warning)
3. WHEN viewing empty states THEN the system SHALL display engaging empty state components with clear call-to-action buttons
4. WHEN forms have validation errors THEN the system SHALL show real-time validation with consistent error styling and messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all interactive elements to be accessible via keyboard and screen readers, so that the platform is usable regardless of my interaction method or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL have proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA labels
3. WHEN viewing forms THEN the system SHALL associate all inputs with proper labels using htmlFor attributes
4. WHEN checking color contrast THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG AA standards for all text and background combinations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want smooth and subtle micro-interactions, so that the interface feels responsive and engaging without being distracting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over cards THEN the system SHALL apply subtle shadow effects with accent color to create floating appearance
2. WHEN hovering over buttons THEN the system SHALL provide smooth color transitions and subtle glow effects
3. WHEN interacting with form inputs THEN the system SHALL change border colors to accent color on focus with smooth transitions
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL use skeleton loaders that match the expected content structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working on the platform, I want a centralized design token system, so that I can maintain consistency and easily update design elements across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining colors THEN the system SHALL centralize all color definitions in Tailwind config with semantic naming
2. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL use design tokens instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN extending the design system THEN the system SHALL provide clear component variants and consistent API patterns
4. WHEN updating design tokens THEN the system SHALL automatically propagate changes across all components using those tokens
